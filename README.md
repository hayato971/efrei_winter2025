  ------------------Website description------------------
                 

Our purpose is to build a To do list web site which allows users to manage their project and tasks easier and more efficiently while keeping the user motivated to reach these goals. It can be used by student and professional people who want to organize their thoughts, order tasks by importance and improve their time management.


  ------------------How does the website work ?------------------

The user arrives on the login page, where he has three options : 
Log in with his login details : Username and Password
Create an account if he does not have one 
Reset his password in case he lost or do not remember it


Once the user has logged in to his account, he's taken to the website's home page, where he can access his profile, view the history of his completed tasks and create a new project (folder) containing all the tasks related to that project.

The creation of the task corresponds to what he has to do (To Do). Then, once the task has been created, it is automatically set to “Doing” status. Finally, the “Done” state contains all tasks completed by the user (a folder must have all its tasks completed before it can be completed).


We offer several features to give the user a reason to finish these tasks and thus motivate him.

First, we'll implement a time system. The user will have 30 days to complete all the tasks created.

Then, there's a points system that will allow the user to see his account evolve. For each task completed, the user will earn points, and for each task not completed before the allotted time, or tasks abandoned (deleted), the user will suffer penalties, i.e. a loss of points.

Finally, depending on the number of points earned, the user can upgrade his account. At the outset, all users will start with Level “E”, and depending on the number of points collected, will be able to move up to the next level (e.g. Level D). The maximum level will be “SS”.


The website will be designed by using frameworks for both HTML/CSS such as tailwind and Javascript with node.js for database management and vue.js for user interfaces.
